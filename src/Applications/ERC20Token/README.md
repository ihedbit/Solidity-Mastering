# ERC20Token Smart Contract

The **ERC20Token** smart contract implements a standard fungible token following the ERC20 standard. It allows for the creation, transfer, and approval of token transfers, ensuring interoperability with Ethereum wallets and dApps.

---

## üìÑ Key Features

- **Token Standard Compliance:**  
  - Implements the ERC20 standard functions such as `transfer`, `approve`, and `transferFrom`.
  
- **Ownership and Approval:**  
  - Token holders can approve others to spend their tokens on their behalf.

- **Event Emission:**  
  - Emits events like `Transfer` and `Approval` for transparency and tracking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contract Breakdown

1. **State Variables**
   - `name`: Token name.
   - `symbol`: Token symbol.
   - `decimals`: Number of decimal places.
   - `totalSupply`: Total token supply.
   - `balances`: Tracks token balances for each address.
   - `allowances`: Tracks spending allowances.

2. **Functions**
   - `balanceOf(address)`: Gets the balance of an account.
   - `transfer(address, uint256)`: Sends tokens from sender to recipient.
   - `approve(address, uint256)`: Allows spender to withdraw tokens.
   - `allowance(address, address)`: Checks approved allowance for spender.
   - `transferFrom(address, address, uint256)`: Executes transfers from an approved allowance.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Compile and Deploy:**  
   - Use **Remix IDE** (https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile and deploy the contract.
   - Set the initial token supply when deploying.
   - Ensure Solidity compiler version `^0.8.0` is selected.

2. **Interact with the Contract:**  
   - Call `balanceOf(address)` to check token balance.  
   - Call `transfer(to, amount)` to send tokens.  
   - Call `approve(spender, amount)` to allow another account to spend your tokens.  
   - Call `transferFrom(from, to, amount)` to spend approved tokens.

## üìå Example Usage

1. Deploy the contract with an initial supply of `1000000`.  
2. Call `balanceOf(msg.sender)` ‚Üí Expect `1,000,000 MTK`.  
3. Call `transfer(0xRecipient, 500)` ‚Üí Sends `500 MTK` to recipient.  
4. Call `approve(0xSpender, 1000)` ‚Üí Allow spender to use `1000 MTK`.  
5. Call `transferFrom(msg.sender, 0xRecipient, 200)` ‚Üí Transfers `200 MTK` from approved balance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **Security Best Practices:**  
  - Avoid approving large token amounts to prevent misuse.
  - Use `transferFrom` carefully to prevent unauthorized spending.

- **Decimals Handling:**  
  - With `18` decimals, `1 MTK` equals `10^18` smallest units.

- **Token Supply:**  
  - Ensure appropriate initial supply when deploying.
