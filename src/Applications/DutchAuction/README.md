# DutchAuction Smart Contract

The **DutchAuction** smart contract implements a **Dutch auction**, where the price of an item starts high and gradually decreases over time until it reaches a reserve price or a buyer accepts the current price.

---

## üìÑ Key Features

- **Gradual Price Reduction:**  
  - The price decreases at specified intervals until the item is sold or the auction ends.

- **Reserve Price:**  
  - The auction will not sell below a minimum reserve price.

- **Immediate Purchase:**  
  - Buyers can purchase the item at any time by paying the current price.

- **Refund Mechanism:**  
  - If a buyer overpays, they are refunded the excess.

- **Auction Cancellation:**  
  - The seller can cancel the auction at any time before it ends.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Compile and Deploy:**  
   - Use **Remix IDE** (https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile and deploy the contract.
   - Deploy with `_startingPrice`, `_reservePrice`, `_duration`, `_priceDropInterval`, and `_priceDropAmount`.

2. **Check Auction Status:**  
   - Call `getCurrentPrice()` to see the current price.

3. **Purchase the Item:**  
   - Send ETH to the contract using `buy()` to purchase at the current price.

4. **Cancel the Auction:**  
   - The seller can call `cancelAuction()` to stop the auction.

## üìå Example Usage

1. **Deploy the contract with:**  
   ```solidity
   _startingPrice = 10 ether,
   _reservePrice = 5 ether,
   _duration = 86400 (1 day),
   _priceDropInterval = 3600 (1 hour),
   _priceDropAmount = 0.5 ether
   ```

2. **Buy at Current Price:**  
   ```solidity
   buy({value: 8 ether});
   ```

3. **Seller Cancels the Auction:**  
   ```solidity
   cancelAuction();
   ```

4. **Check Current Auction Price:**  
   ```solidity
   getCurrentPrice();
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Dutch Auctions Work

1. **Auction Initialization:**  
   - The seller sets the starting price, reserve price, and auction duration.

2. **Price Reduction:**  
   - The price decreases by a fixed amount at regular intervals.

3. **Buyer Purchase:**  
   - The first buyer to accept the current price wins the auction.

4. **Expiration:**  
   - If no buyer accepts before the duration ends, the auction concludes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **Fair Pricing:**  
  - Ensure an appropriate reserve price to avoid selling too low.

- **Gas Costs:**  
  - Buyers should account for gas fees when placing bids.

- **Auction Duration:**  
  - Set a reasonable duration to allow sufficient bidding.
