# MappingWithStructs Smart Contract

The **MappingWithStructs** contract demonstrates how to combine mappings with structs to create efficient and organized data storage in Solidity. This approach is particularly useful for managing user-related data and efficiently accessing it.

## 📄 Key Features

- **Struct-Based Organization:**  
  - Encapsulates user attributes in a structured format.
  - Allows for easy access and modification of stored data.

- **Efficient Lookups with Mappings:**  
  - Enables constant-time retrieval of user data.
  - Prevents redundant data storage.

- **User Management:**  
  - Register, retrieve, update, and delete user records.
  - Check if a user is registered.

## 🛠️ Contract Breakdown

1. **State Variables**
   - `mapping(address => User) users`: Maps an address to a `User` struct.
   - `mapping(address => bool) registered`: Tracks if a user is registered.

2. **Functions**
   - `registerUser(string _name, uint256 _age)`: Registers a new user.
   - `getUser(address _userAddress)`: Retrieves user details.
   - `updateAge(uint256 _newAge)`: Updates the user's age.
   - `deleteUser()`: Removes the user from storage.
   - `isUserRegistered(address _userAddress)`: Checks if an address is registered.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Compile and Deploy:**  
   - Use **Remix IDE** (https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile and deploy the contract.
   - Ensure Solidity compiler version `^0.8.0` is selected.

2. **Interact with the Contract:**  
   - Call `registerUser("Alice", 30)` → Registers Alice with age 30.  
   - Call `getUser(msg.sender)` → Returns stored user data.  
   - Call `updateAge(35)` → Updates Alice's age to 35.  
   - Call `deleteUser()` → Removes Alice from storage.

## 📌 Example Usage

1. Deploy the contract.  
2. Call `registerUser("Bob", 28)` to add a user.  
3. Call `getUser(Bob's Address)` → Expect details `[Bob, 28, Bob's Address, true]`.  
4. Call `updateAge(29)` → Update age to 29.  
5. Call `deleteUser()` → Remove Bob's data.  
6. Call `isUserRegistered(Bob's Address)` → Expect `false`.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

- **Gas Optimization:**  
  - Use mappings efficiently to avoid unnecessary data storage.
  - Deleting mappings does not recover gas; it only resets values to default.

- **Security:**  
  - Ensure user registration is unique to prevent duplicate entries.
  - Implement access control for sensitive functions if required.

- **Mapping Limitations:**  
  - Solidity mappings do not support enumeration or iteration.
  - External tools may be needed to track all stored users.
