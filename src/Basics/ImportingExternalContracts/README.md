# ImportingExternalContracts Smart Contract

The **ImportingExternalContracts** smart contract demonstrates how to **reuse code by importing contracts and libraries** from other Solidity files. This technique improves modularity, code reusability, and maintainability in Solidity projects.

---

## üìÑ Key Features

- **External Contract Importing:**  
  - Demonstrates the `import` keyword to include external contracts or libraries.
  
- **Library Usage:**  
  - Imports a custom `MathLibrary` with reusable mathematical functions.
  - Utilizes Solidity's `using for` statement to extend functionality.

- **Access Control:**  
  - Implements an `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contract Breakdown

1. **State Variables**
   - `address public owner`: Stores the deployer's address.

2. **Modifiers**
   - `onlyOwner()`: Ensures only the contract owner can execute certain functions.

3. **Functions**
   - `addNumbers(uint256 _a, uint256 _b)`: Calls an imported library function to add numbers.
   - `subtractNumbers(uint256 _a, uint256 _b)`: Calls an imported library function to subtract numbers.

4. **Library**
   - `MathLibrary`: A separate contract file providing `add()` and `subtract()` functions.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Compile and Deploy:**  
   - Ensure you have two files:  
     - `ImportingExternalContracts.sol` (Main contract)
     - `MathLibrary.sol` (Library)
   - Use **Remix IDE** (https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile and deploy the contract.
   - Ensure Solidity compiler version `^0.8.0` is selected.

2. **Interact with the Contract:**  
   - Call `addNumbers(10, 20)` to see the sum.  
   - Call `subtractNumbers(50, 15)` to get the difference.

---

## üìå Example Usage

1. Deploy the contract.  
2. Call `addNumbers(10, 20)` ‚Üí Expect output `30`.  
3. Call `subtractNumbers(50, 20)` ‚Üí Expect output `30`.  
4. Try `subtractNumbers(10, 20)` ‚Üí Expect revert due to underflow error.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **File Structure:**  
  - Always place the imported files in the same directory or specify the correct relative path.
  - Use correct file naming conventions when importing in Remix or Hardhat.

- **Gas Optimization:**  
  - Libraries help optimize gas by avoiding code duplication.
  - Use `internal` visibility in libraries to link them efficiently.

- **Security:**  
  - Ensure imported contracts and libraries are trusted and reviewed before using.
  - Avoid importing large third-party libraries that could increase deployment costs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è When to Use External Contract Imports

| Use Case                   | Suggested Approach                |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Common mathematical logic  | Import reusable libraries         |
| Modular contract structure | Separate contract functionalities |
| Upgradability              | Use imported contracts for logic separation |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solidity Import Methods

Solidity supports several ways to import contracts:

1. **Relative Imports (Recommended for local files)**  
   ```solidity
   import "./MathLibrary.sol";
   ```

2. **Direct Path Imports**  
   ```solidity
   import "contracts/MathLibrary.sol";
   ```

3. **Third-Party Imports (e.g., OpenZeppelin)**  
   ```solidity
   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
   ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Solidity compiler version `^0.8.0`
- Ethereum development tools like **Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle**
- MetaMask for interacting with deployed contracts
